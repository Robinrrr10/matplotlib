Matplotlib notes:
----------------

Here I have used below tutorial for learning matplotlib

Matplotlib Tutorial 1 - Introduction and Installation:
------------------------------------------------------
What is matplotlib:
This the data virtualization tool.
This will show the data in the format of any 2D format like graph, chart and many more format.
This is one of the python library

Use below command to install matplot

pip install matplotlib

//This can also comes along with anaconda. 
If we are already using alaconda, use below command to list the installed library and check whether matplotlib was already installed or not


We can use it in any this in any of the python project.
We can see the results in jupyter noteboook or IDE like pycharm, vscode etc
If we are using jupyter notebook use below line to show the virtualization 
%matplotlib inline


Why we need this.
It is always good to see the data in the image.
Human can easily understand and faster when seeing the image than the text


Below is the portal for matplotlib:
https://matplotlib.org/
We can refer this for more details



pyplot is one of the widely used data virtualization in matplotlib
https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/pyplot.html
https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html
This link will give more details about pyplot and how we can use this


Below is one of simple example

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline               # this is required only on jupyter
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
y = [41, 40, 42, 38, 41, 39, 41]
plt.plot(x,y)    # This is show the line graph of x and y 


Below is along with color and line width
plt.plot(x,y,color='red', linewidth=4 )   # this is the same with color and line width

Below is along with color, linewidth, marker, linestyle
plt.plot(x,y,color='red', linewidth=1, marker='o', linestyle='dotted')

To add title, we can use
plt.title = 'giveTitleHere'

To add x label 
plt.xlabel = 'giveXLabelHere'

To add y label
plt.ylabel = 'giveYLabelHere'

Below is the example along with title and labels
plt.xlabel = 'Day'
plt.ylabel = 'Temperature'
plt.title = "Weather of the day"
plt.plot(x,y,color='green', linewidth=2, marker='+', linestyle='dashed')

Matplotlib Tutorial 2 - format strings in plot function
------------------------------------------------------
Here we can see format function and some attributes
Format string is the short way to give the attributes to plotting

We can use different format string to give the color, marker, linestyle and other.
Eg:
g+ means green with + marker
r*-- means red with start marker with dotted lines

We can give like below
plt.plot(x,y,'g+')

plt.plot(x,y, 'r*--')

We can give in below. But order does not matter. It will string work
'[marker][line][color]'

'+--r'    # + marker   -- line   red color

There are format string. Please refer on below link for more details
https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html



We can also given the attribute name and value instead of format string
color    # color we can give in string or we can give in hexa value
marker
linestyle
markersize

Eg:
plt.plot(x,y, color='red', marker='*', linestyle='dotted', markersize=2)


plt.plot(x,y, color='#562384', marker='*', linestyle='dotted', markersize=5)

For more details refer below
https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html

alpha:
alpha is to control the transparancy
alpha=1 is the no transparancy 
alpha=0.5 is half transperance
alpha=0 mens is complete transparancy

Eg:
plt.plot(x, y, color='blue', alpha=0.2)

Refer all details in below
https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html
